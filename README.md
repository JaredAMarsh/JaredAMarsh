# Hi there, I'm Jared 👋 (He/Him)

## 👨‍💻 About Me
I'm a BSc Computer Science graduate (First Class) passionate about development, particularly web development. Since I was little, I've been fascinated with computers and have been tinkering with the web since middle school. It was only HTML at the time, but now I can develop fully functioning applications that can make a difference in the world. Be that bringing a smile to someone's face, making processes more efficient or improving productivity.

## 🕹️ My Interests
- 📖 Open-source software, web frameworks and games.
- 🌐 Web Development
    - PHP, particularly using the Slim framework, though I have experience with Yii.
    - JavaScript, looking to learn React and other popular frontend frameworks, as well as dive into Node.js.
    - HTML/CSS, with an emphasis on semantic HTML, div soup is bad! (Familiar with the bootstrap CSS framework)
- 💻 Tech and Gaming
    - Computer Hardware / PC Building.
    - Tech support, though usually for friends/family, normally just turning it off and on again.
    - Gaming with friends, meeting new people and game modding.
- Languages I'm familiar with (In skill order): PHP, JavaScript, HTML/CSS, SQL, Java, Scala, C#

I am, however, more than happy to learn any frameworks, languages or technologies that aren't listed here, learning is essential, and without learning, life gets somewhat repetitive.

## 💼 What I'm looking to work on
I'm looking to work on anything that can mentally challenge me, make a difference or preferably both. Open-source projects with a lot of collaboration are something I would be interested in working on. A small team or even solo development work would be just as fun but for different reasons. Collaborating on problems is good, but so is being a key part of something or solving solutions solo. By "make a difference", I mean something that will have a real effect on people, be that one person or many, and be it by making them smile or by improving a company's efficiency, I would be happy to be a part of it.
